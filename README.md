# Overview

This is a project where I explored the uses and syntax of the C++ language.

The main program in this project is the 'Commerse.cpp' file. In this file I have made a simple program simulating the backend system monitering and controlling data for an online store system.

1. Products and quantity are selected by a customer.
2. Products are added to a card and saved to an Order.
3. Recipts are displayed and a Purchase History is saved for an individual Customer.

All of the customer interactions are assumed to have taken place and are simulated in the main function.

* Note that the 'main.cpp', 'product.cpp', and 'product.h' files are note complete and I'm trying to learn pointers using these files. There are some compile problems within these 3 files, so don't expect them to run at the moment.

The 'Hobbit.cpp' program is just a simple exercize I did to learn C++ syntax with OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

All of the other files are more for familiarizing myself, learning, and referenceing C++ syntax. I also have one or two files I wrote more for fun then anything.

# Development Environment

I used Microsoft Visual Studio Code as my editor, along with the Code Runner extension for compileing the code.

I also used Repl to compare different compile results from VS Code and Repl's clang compiler. I also used Repl for some collaboration with others to help me understand complex C++ syntax.

# Useful Websites

I scoured the internet trying learn this language, these are the more useful sites I found:

* [My Commerse.cpp file on Repl if you don't have a compiler](https://replit.com/@TheMaughan/Commerce)
* [YouTube tutorial for operator overloading]([https://youtu.be/BO2KagRMS3M](https://youtu.be/BO2KagRMS3M))
* [operator overloading with vectors](https://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/127918/)
* [A Repel I used as a reference for pointers and objects in C++](https://replit.com/@cmacbeth/Objects)
  * Please note that the above Repl is not my code, I'm only referencing it because it has been really useful for learning Pointers.
* [Programiz.com/cpp-programming](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming)
* [Vector Iterator](https://riptutorial.com/cplusplus/example/7877/vector-iterator)
* [C++ for anyone who already knows OOP in Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/cpp4python/index.html)
  * I get really annoyed with all the beginner tutorials online when I need something more in-depth, the above site is a good reference if you already understand OOP.
* [Overloading tutorial in Repl](https://replit.com/talk/learn/Overloading-Operators-in-C/35455)

# Future Work

* Include some user input for the Commerse program
* Finnish the commerse program (which consists of 'main.cpp', 'product.cpp', and 'product.h' for now)
* Perhaps in the near future I can implement some of my own scripts into any 3D program that is or is similar to Revit, Blender, or Unity.
